# Git Lab... not GitLab ...

Alright, so you feel like messing around with some `git`?! 

You don't NEED GitHub (or GitLab) for that, you can toy around with most of `git`  
right on your command-line.

First, make sure you have `git` installed ( you likely do )

```bash
╰─ git
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]
```

Next up I'm gonna have some tasks that you'll want to step through and see if you can complete.  
Before we go on I'd like to point you to some reading materials or references; use them how you like.

  * This is THE book, the resource of resources
* [Learn Git in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/git/)
  * This is Cliff/Spark Notes for `git`

## Things to do:

- [] Clone this repository (`git clone`)
- [] Checkout a new branch, be short, but descriptive. (`git checkout`)
- [] Add A File, name it what you like, be creative
  - Run `git status` note what you see...
- [] Assuming you're on a macbook/linux environment
- [] Edit `file1.txt` to say something else.
